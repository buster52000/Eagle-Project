These files will explain the process of adding more scrambles, puzzles, and trivia to the game.
The template files will look something like this:
1. Explanation of file
2. Format:
   "Format"

Everything after "Format:" will be what is needed in the filedo not include the word "Format:" or anything before it.
Also make sure you do not leave any of the things in the format out.
If you are not sure use the files that are already in the game as a reference.
After making a new file always test it to be sure it works. If it does not work contact the developer for assistance.
