This stone tavern was built in 1753.  Local politicians would meet here to exchange news and to conduct meetings. Some important men who stayed her include John Adams of Mass., William Ellery of R.I., and William Whipple of N.H., all signers of the Declaration of Independence.  During the French and Indian Wars, sixty-five treaties with the Lenape people were signed in the tavern.  The Bachmann Tavern is open for Easton Celebration Days, Northampton County Passport to History Days and by appointment.
