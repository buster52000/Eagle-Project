This swallow-tailed flag was carried by the 19TH Pennsylvania Volunteer Cavalry.  This Cavalry unit was formed in Philadelphia in 1863 for men to volunteer to fight in the Civil War. Most of the men were from the Philadelphia area but two companies were from the Hunterdon and Blair counties.   The unit fought in Mississippi, Kentucky, Tennessee and Louisiana.  The unit was mustered out in 1866, after the end of the war.
