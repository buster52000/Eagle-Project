Earl Held was a member of the John Philip Sousa band until 1931.  In 1936 he formed an all girls marching and concert band in Easton Pa.  The band played throughout the Lehigh Valley until 1972.  The band performed in parades, at Sunday school picnics, in parks and in concerts.  They played marches and classical music.  Girls joined in high school.  Many of the members joined as young girls and stayed with the band to the end.  Mr Held wanted his girls to be ladies; he had strict rules on skirt length and not smoking. Any payment to the band was divided equally among the girls, which could be pennies a girl.  In later years, the girls were paid 75 cents a performance.
