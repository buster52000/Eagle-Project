The Nicholas House is one of the few buildings in Easton remaining from the colonial era.  It is important because it has always been the home of a working class family. The "bank" house was built about 1807.  Much of the interior woodwork is original.  The house is open on Easton Celebration Days, Northampton County Passport to History Days and by appointment.
