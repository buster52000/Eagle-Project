The Pennsylvania long rifle was developed by  German gunsmiths who immigrated to southeastern Pennsylvania in the early 1700s.  The long rifle became more popular than the smooth bore musket because of their longer effective range.  The range of a long rifle was 200 yards or more but it took longer to reload than a musket.   One of the reasons for building such a weapon is due to the vastness of the new world’s forests.  It required hunters to carry more supplies.  The long rifle used smaller ammunition and reduced the weight they had to carry while hunting.  The longer barrel also gave the black powder more time to burn, which increased the speed of the bullet and its accuracy.
