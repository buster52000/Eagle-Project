When first made in 1953, it took 27 hours to make one PEEP Marshmallow Chick. Today, thanks to technology, it takes six minutes. PEEPS have been the #1 non-chocolate brand at Easter for over 20 years.  The yellow and white chicks came first; now they come in a variety of colors and are made in a variety of shapes for all the different holiday seasons.  
Peeps!
