A bed warmer consists of a pan with a perforated lid on a hinge, made of copper, brass or cast iron.  A pile of coals from a fire is placed in the pan and the lid closed. The heat escapes through the holes into the bed, as the pan is moved along the sheets under the covers.  These were mostly used in the cold months, before central heating.
