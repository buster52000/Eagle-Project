Dowsing Rod
A way to find water
/gameFiles/pics/dowsingrod.jpg
Dowsing is a way to "see" underground to find water.  A dowsing rod is usually a forked or Y shaped branch or a pair of L-shaped metal rods. Hold the Y ends one in each hand with the stem pointed in front of you. As you walk slowly along, the rod will twitch or dip to indicate that water or something has been found. If the L-shaped rod is used, the short part of the L is held in each hand, while the longer part is forward.  When something is discovered, the rods cross over each other to form an X.
