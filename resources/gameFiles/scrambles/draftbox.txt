The draft box was use in Easton during the Civil War to draft men for the Union Army.  Names of eligible men from the Easton area were written on pieces of cardboard and placed in the revolving box. A blindfolded person would choose a name out of the box and that man would serve in the Union Army. The draft was started in 1863 for all unmarried men first, then married men.  A man could get out of the draft by hiring a substitute or paying $300 to the government instead.
