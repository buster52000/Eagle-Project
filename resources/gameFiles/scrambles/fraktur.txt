Fraktur are colorful documents made by Pennsylvania Germans who lived in rural southeastern Pennsylvania.  It let German immigrants preserve their heritage and way of life.  Most Fraktur art was created between 1740 and 1860.  This name was given because German script was marked by fractured pen strokes.  Fraktur art was created in many forms such as writing samples, birth certificates, marriage blessings and many more. Fraktur artists commonly used items like birds, hearts, tulips, black letters, and calligraphy in their art.  The artists mainly used ink and watercolors. The art was first made by hand but later it was printed.  By the late 1800s with the wide use of the printing press, Fraktur art slowly dwindled.
