Mechanical toy banks became popular in the mid 1800s, as a way to encourage children to save their money.  Between 1869 and 1910, there were over 300 patents on mechanical banks. These banks were small, usually cast iron containers, which performed an action when a coin was put into a slot and a lever was pulled.  They were very decorative and depicted a variety of events from historical to the every day.
