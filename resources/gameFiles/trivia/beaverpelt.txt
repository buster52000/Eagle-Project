Beaver pelts
The Beaver pelt trade was very extensive in North America.  In regards to the Lehigh Valley area, the Lenni Lenape were the Native Americans who originally lived in this area.  They were one of the primary tribes that made wampum or shell beads out of clam and whelk shells.  The Lenape would trade their wampum for beaver pelts from the various other Indian tribes, who did not have access to the shells.  When the European trading companies came to North America, they developed a friendship with the Lenape and traded manufactured goods for the pelts.  As the European settlements grew, the Lenape became  intermediaries with the other tribes.  These tribes caught and cured the beavers, which were sold or traded for company goods.
