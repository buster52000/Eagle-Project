In 1785 Christian Bixler III opened a jewelry and clock store in Easton PA on land that he bought from the Penn family.  He had apprenticed with his father in Reading, after his military service during the Revolutionary War.  Bixler was known for making tall piece clocks and handmade over 450 in his lifetime, as well as silver pieces.  The business passed onto his descendants.  For 223 years Bixler’s was located in Easton PA and known as America’s Oldest Jewelers.
