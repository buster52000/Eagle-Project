Drums were used both in camp and in battle.  At camp, different drum calls meant different things from waking up to assembling officers to breakfast.  During battle, the drummer stood near an senior officer to beat out the battle plans - attack, retreat. The drums also kept beat for the men marching. The drummer, a boy to young to fight, was always available to send out messages by drums and when he wasn't drumming he carried stretchers of wounded or literally ran messages between camps.
