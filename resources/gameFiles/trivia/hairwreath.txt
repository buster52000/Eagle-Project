Hair Wreath
The wreath was made out of the hair from the deceased person and his/her friends and family. The hair would be woven into flowers around a wire.  These decorations were put together in a horseshoe shape with the open end pointed heavenward. Some wreaths are very colorful and vary in textures because of the many hair types used.
