Pumper Truck
This pumper truck was hand-drawn by firefighters, not pulled by horses. A team of up to 10 men, five per side, would power the pump by pulling down the pump handle on their side of the engine. On the pump handle at the front end, you will see a brass plate wrapped around the handle. That was the foreman's station. The foreman called the cadence of the men pumping to provide the needed flow of water. Pumping teams would frequently need to be rotated, reportedly every 10 to 20 minutes depending on the cadence. A good team would produce a steady water stream similar to what a modern-day garden hose delivers.
